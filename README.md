A simple IGT and split tracker for my own use with the EPIC release of The Evil Within (2014). Just because I find LiveSplit a bit clumsy to set up when practicing one or 2 subsplits in a game.

A bit of vibe coding with ChatGPT to produce this python app. It was quicker than I could of created it, but I think the output is more complex than it needs to be.
